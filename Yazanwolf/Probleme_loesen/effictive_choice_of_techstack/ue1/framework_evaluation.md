 Type: Full JavaScript framework, it offers everything needed for building complex web applications like Dependency injection, state management routing and more.
 Learn difficulty: can be more difficult than react and vue, as being a comprehensive framework can make it's verbose syntax hard to understand at the beginning.

 Type: JavaScript library, that means, for topics like state management you need to use extra libraries, this can making integration of other libraries more of a work.
 Learn difficulty: Simpler than Angular as it focuses only on the view part of an application.

 Type: JavaScript library, same as react, you need to integrate the needed external libraries yourself.
 Learn difficulty: Very simple and strait forward.

 I'd rather Angular as it provides a solution for all concepts like state management which will probably be needed for the E-commerse application,
 As Angular provides SSR, it can surely improve the performance.
 Other than the learn difficulty, I don't see any other contras that may affect the development process.
