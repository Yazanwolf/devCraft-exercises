  <title>JS Laden Problem</title>
  <!-- script1 can be async as it doesn't depend on any DOM element, so it can load and execute asyncrhonosly without any problem. -->
  <script src="js/script1.js" async></script>
  <!-- script2 gives the button "loadScript" it's functionality, hence it shlould be first executed after the button is rendered.
  Being placed at the end of the body is okay but unnecessarily delay it's loading until the end, a better solution would be moving
  it into the head and adding "defer" to it so that it loads as fast as possible but doesn't execute until the DOM is fully rendered.
  -->
  <script src="js/script2.js" defer></script>
  <!-- This script is blocking and cannot be async therefore must be either deleted, 
   moved into an external js data with async attribute, or placed at the end of the body element 
   I am commenting it out as it serves no purpose
  -->
  <!-- <script>
    console.log("Inline script!")
