Changes I've made:
    1- Blogcontent section a different background color and a margin-right of 10px so that it's easy to distinguish the content from sidebar.
    2- I added to the top image a little bit of radius "20px" so that it looks smoother.

I liked that the blog page looked good on both website and smartphone, the structure of the html elements is very good and detailed, the names of the css classes are meaningful, it made the navigation through elements much easier.
